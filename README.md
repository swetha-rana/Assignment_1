question_1.py : The code downloads the fashion_mnist data sets and plots the one image from each class

question_2.py : This program file implements the feed forward propagation and outputs the probabilities of the images for each class.
The program is flexible to change the no.of hidden layers and size of each hiiden leyer. 
In order to change the hidden layers and size of hidden layer, set layers_dims variable.

question_3.py : Implement the backpropagation algorithm with support for the following optimisation functions 
                  - sgd
                  - momentum based gradient descent
                  - nesterov accelerated gradient descent
                  - rmsprop
                  - adam
                  - nadam
                  
By setting the batch_size variable we can change the batch size. 

Question4.ipynb program has algorithm to do wandb sweeps.
